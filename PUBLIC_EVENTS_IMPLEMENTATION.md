# Public Event Visibility Implementation

## Overview
This document explains how the system ensures that all events created by any user are publicly visible and accessible to all users for ticket purchasing.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Public Events Route (`GET /events`)
- **Location**: `backend/routes/events.js` (lines 25-100)
- **Purpose**: Shows all published events from ALL users (public access)
- **Authentication**: None required
- **Filtering**: Only shows events with `status = 'published'`
- **Data**: Includes organizer information (`organizer_name`, `organizer_avatar`)

```javascript
// Get all events (public - no authentication required)
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const query = `
    SELECT e.*, u.username as organizer_name, u.avatar_url as organizer_avatar
    FROM events e
    JOIN users u ON e.organizer_id = u.id
    WHERE e.status = 'published'
  `;
  // ... rest of implementation
});
```

### 2. User-Specific Events Route (`GET /my/events`)
- **Location**: `backend/routes/events.js` (lines 102-115)
- **Purpose**: Shows only the authenticated user's own events
- **Authentication**: Required (JWT token)
- **Filtering**: `WHERE organizer_id = ?` (current user only)

```javascript
// Get user's own events (authenticated users only - only their own events)
router.get('/my/events', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.userId; // User can only see their own events
  
  db.all(`
    SELECT * FROM events 
    WHERE organizer_id = ? 
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
  `, [userId], (err, events) => {
    // ... implementation
  });
});
```

### 3. Event Creation
- **Location**: `backend/routes/events.js` (lines 117-200)
- **Status**: All events are created with `status = 'published'` by default
- **Ownership**: Events are automatically assigned to the creating user (`organizer_id = userId`)

```javascript
const stmt = db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO events (
    organizer_id, title, description, /* ... other fields */
    status, /* ... other fields */
  ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'published', /* ... other values */)
`);
```

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Events API (`src/lib/api.ts`)
- **Public Events**: `eventsAPI.getAll()` calls `GET /events` (public endpoint)
- **User Events**: `eventsAPI.getUserEvents()` calls `GET /users/events` (private endpoint)

```typescript
export const eventsAPI = {
  getAll: async () => {
    return apiRequest('/events'); // Public - no auth required
  },
  
  getUserEvents: async () => {
    return apiRequest('/users/events'); // Private - auth required
  },
  // ... other methods
};
```

### 2. Events Page (`src/pages/Events.tsx`)
- **Data Source**: Uses `eventsAPI.getAll()` to fetch all public events
- **Display**: Shows events from all users, not just the current user
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging to verify events from different organizers

```typescript
const fetchEvents = async () => {
  // Get all published events (this should include events from ALL users)
  const response = await eventsAPI.getAll() as { events: any[] };
  
  // Verify that we're getting events from different users
  const eventOrganizers = [...new Set(response.events.map(e => e.organizer_id))];
  console.log('ðŸ‘¥ Events from different organizers:', eventOrganizers);
  
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

### 3. Event Display Components

#### EventGrid (`src/components/EventGrid.tsx`)
- **Transformation**: Converts backend event data to frontend format
- **Organizer Info**: Passes organizer information to EventCard

```typescript
const transformedEvent = {
  // ... other fields
  organizerName: event.organizer_name || event.organizerName,
  organizerId: event.organizer_id || event.organizerId
};
```

#### EventCard (`src/components/EventCard.tsx`)
- **Organizer Display**: Shows "Organized by: [Username]" for each event
- **Public Visibility**: Clearly indicates that events are from different users

```typescript
{/* Organizer information */}
{organizerName && (
  <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 text-blue-600 text-xs">
    <span>ðŸ‘¤</span>
    <span>Organized by: {organizerName}</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## User Experience Features

### 1. Public Events Notice
- **Location**: Events page header
- **Message**: "All events are publicly visible! Browse and purchase tickets from any user's events."
- **Visual**: Green banner with globe icon

### 2. Event Organizer Statistics
- **Display**: Shows count of different organizers
- **Message**: "Event Organizers: Events from X different users"
- **Purpose**: Confirms that events from multiple users are visible

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- **Console Logs**: Detailed logging of events from different organizers
- **Event Breakdown**: Shows total events, Web3 events, traditional events
- **Organizer Tracking**: Logs organizer IDs and names for verification

## Security and Access Control

### 1. Public Read Access
- âœ… **Events List**: Anyone can view all published events
- âœ… **Event Details**: Anyone can view individual event information
- âœ… **Ticket Purchase**: Anyone can purchase tickets from any event

### 2. Private Write Access
- âœ… **Event Creation**: Only authenticated users can create events
- âœ… **Event Updates**: Only event owners can update their events
- âœ… **Event Deletion**: Only event owners can delete their events
- âœ… **Event Statistics**: Only event owners can view their event analytics

### 3. Data Privacy
- âœ… **User Information**: Only username and avatar are exposed (no sensitive data)
- âœ… **Event Data**: All event details are public (as intended for discovery)
- âœ… **Ticket Data**: User ticket purchases remain private

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Create Multiple User Accounts
```bash
# User 1 creates an event
# User 2 creates an event
# User 3 creates an event
```

### 2. Verify Public Visibility
- âœ… All users can see all events in the Events page
- âœ… Organizer names are displayed for each event
- âœ… Event statistics show events from multiple organizers

### 3. Test Ticket Purchases
- âœ… User 2 can buy tickets from User 1's event
- âœ… User 3 can buy tickets from User 2's event
- âœ… User 1 can buy tickets from User 3's event

## Key Benefits

1. **True Public Marketplace**: Events are discoverable by all users
2. **Cross-User Engagement**: Users can participate in events created by others
3. **Transparent Ownership**: Clear indication of who organized each event
4. **Secure Access Control**: Maintains privacy while enabling public discovery
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports unlimited users and events

## Conclusion

The system successfully implements public event visibility where:
- All published events are visible to all users
- Users can purchase tickets from any user's events
- Event ownership is clearly displayed
- Security is maintained through proper access controls
- The frontend clearly communicates the public nature of events

This creates a true marketplace where event organizers can reach a wider audience and users can discover events from various creators.
