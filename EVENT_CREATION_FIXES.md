# Event Creation User Flow Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Web3 Event Creation Not Visible After Creation
- **Problem**: Web3 events are created on blockchain but not visible in the events list
- **Root Cause**: Web3 events are only stored on blockchain, not synced to backend database
- **Impact**: Users can't see their created Web3 events in the main events page

### 2. Web3 Event Creation Failing with Smart Contract Errors
- **Problem**: Web3 event creation fails with JSON-RPC error -32603 and truncated transaction data
- **Root Cause**: Invalid event configuration data or smart contract connection issues
- **Impact**: Users cannot create Web3 events at all

### 3. Form Field Mapping Issues
- **Problem**: Form data is not properly mapped to backend API fields
- **Root Cause**: Mismatch between frontend form structure and backend database schema
- **Impact**: Events may not save correctly or display properly

### 3. Missing Event Type Field
- **Problem**: Event type field is missing from traditional event creation
- **Root Cause**: Form validation and submission doesn't include eventType
- **Impact**: Events may not be categorized properly

### 4. Web3 Event Data Sync
- **Problem**: Web3 events lack proper backend synchronization
- **Root Cause**: No automatic backend event creation after blockchain success
- **Impact**: Web3 events are isolated from the main event system

## Fixes Required

- Handle Web3 event source identification

### ✅ Fix 3.5: Fix Web3 Smart Contract Errors
- Validate and sanitize event configuration data
- Ensure proper data types and array lengths
- Add fallback to traditional event creation
- Implement connection testing and debugging tools

### ✅ Fix 4: Improve Form Validation
- Add proper validation for all required fields
- Show validation errors clearly
- Prevent submission with invalid data

### ✅ Fix 5: Fix Web3 Event Display
- Ensure Web3 events appear in events list
- Handle blockchain transaction data properly
- Show Web3 event indicators

### ✅ Fix 5.5: Fix EventGrid Component Errors
- Handle undefined category values in getDefaultImage function
- Add proper null checks for all event properties
- Support both raw backend data and pre-transformed data
- Add error boundaries and fallback event cards
- Implement comprehensive data validation

### ✅ Fix 6: Improve Error Handling
- Better error messages for form validation
- Handle API failures gracefully
- Provide user feedback for all operations
